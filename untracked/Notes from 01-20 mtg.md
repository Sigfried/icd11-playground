Chris wish:
	Show polyhierarchy. Maybe badge with parent count and drill down on hover or click
		should be navigable
		should probably be in .NET	
To have proposal authoring that reflects and affects foundation structure, and I'm building it, it should be in open stack
First step: author proposal that reflects structure and provides structure to facilitate implementation
	Later use iCAT (maintenance platform) API calls to implement
		replacing WebProtoge (iCAT 1.0)
		iCAT 2.0 environment has an API and other functional enhancements beyond 1.0
		the world guru -- can connect through Can at some point
- rerender Foundation to convey polyhierarchy
	- use the widgets for the polyhierarchy in generating a proposal
	- be sure to show as-is and after (think about tree diff?)
	- eventually translate tree diff into iCAT API

- iCAT info (only 1.0 I think)
